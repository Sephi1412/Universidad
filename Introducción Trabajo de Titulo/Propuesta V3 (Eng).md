# Introduction

## Background

Our planet currently is living one of the biggest hydric and environmental crisis in recorded history. Every year gets worse and it does not seems that is going to stop. The main responsible of said crisis is humanity itself. The aggressive way in which we interact with nature, dominating it instead of living in harmony with it, has caused practically irreversible damage.

There are models that suggests ways of living with nature such as Permaculture, which proposes the creation and develop of auto sufficient agricultural systems that doesn't result in damage for our environment. The methods and models postulated by permaculture could be the key to use the resources that each day are becoming more scarce giving nature room to heal.

While it is true that there are ideas to stop our current crisis out there, there not a clear path to follow. But is safe to say that polishing our current knowledge in nature is a good starting point. Putting our efforts in developing tools that allow us to better understand it and create new solutions under similar approaches to permaculture that allow us to live a life in harmony with nature could our only way to survive.


## Problem
There are lots of instructors and teachers around the world that are using digital platforms, such as social media websites to spread information and creating awareness with the intention to get the attention that this crisis should have.  Other applications of such platforms include conducting online classes.

While it's true that those platforms have a wide reach, even with the capacity of breaking cultural and linguistic barriers, making them great for imparting classes, there's a catch: Online classes loses the active learning that otherwise could be gotten doing said classes on-site. In the case of studying nature, there is other problem: It needs time develop, grow and evolve.

Andrew Millison is an instructor in the Horticulture department who makes courses on permaculture at the Oregon University in introductory and advanced levels. Some of these courses are online, which allows him to reach the houses of hundreds of students. In said courses he uses an Augmented Reality sandbox (AR Sandbox), that allows him to create different types of terrains and illustrate concepts related to his courses.  He also has a YouTube channel where he upload videos related to permaculture that had created a healthy space of discussion where new ideas could be born.

Just like Andrew, there are lots of people out there with great initiatives or projects that could be the key to solve this environmental crisis, but there are not enough resources or tools available for everyone to impulse such talents.

## Hypothesis
Currently we live in a society where technology has become an essential part of our lives. Practically everyone has access to a computer or a smartphone. This motivates us to propose the following question:

What if applications that allow the user to illustrate concepts or test new ideas or models, such as the AR Sandbox, were easily available for everyone to use from the comfort of their own computers?

Tools of easy access could change radically how courses of, for example, permaculture, are made. The time required to see how natures develops is not going to be a problem anymore, since a virtual environment could make time-accelerated simulations. In addition, it would not require so many resources or even a propriety to put to a test different agriculture/horticulture models that could revolutionize how we work with nature.

## Proposal

That's why we propose the creation of an accessible interactive simulator that allows the user to replicate as much as possible of what can be done with Andrew's AR Sandbox. The main features of this application should be:

- Allow the users to create terrains and give it any shape that they want to make simulations in **accelerated time**.
 - Display the contour lines of the created terrain.
 - Water simulations that interact in real time with the terrain previously generated.
 - Make available to the user multiple items or objects, such as trees, that can influence the outcome of the simulations.
 - In the context of a course, allow the teacher or instructor to create test scenarios so that students can analyze and answer certain questions.
