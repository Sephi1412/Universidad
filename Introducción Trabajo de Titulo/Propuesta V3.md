# Introduction
- Current Crisis
- We could find solutions, but is not the priority of the society
- We have knowledge and technology. Only it's needed to put the focus on this issue

Our planet is currently experiencing one of the most critical water and environmental crises in recorded history, being the aggressive human intervention in nature the main culprit. We as a species have spent many years trying to dominate nature by force, causing practically irreversible damage instead of working together with it. Noticing all the damage we already made, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren created the concept of permaculture, a way of living that tries to turn our negative impact over nature into a positive one. Most people ignore said crisis, either because they have their own problems or they simply do not know his magnitude. That's why even when this could end our civilization, not a lot of resources are put into find solutions.

Even if the current scenario doesn't seems to be positive at all, we have knowledge and technology at our service that could be use to find a way to stop this environmental crisis. We live in a society where smartphones and computers are used for everything. It's easier than ever to spread information and give to the world access to software and applications that could help us to deal with this crisis. At this point, it's obvious that there's not a clear path to follow to stop this. But it's also obvious that using technology to learn how we can use our limited resources efficiently, to improve our understanding in nature or making this information available for everyone, it's a good start.

There're lot of instructors and teachers around the world that are using digital platforms to do classes and even using social media platforms to spread awareness. But there is a clear problem: we are losing the active learning that we could have in a classroom. Also, there other issue that is inherently related to the study of nature: We lose part of the active learning just by the fact that it requires time to develop, to evolve, to grow.


Andrew Millison. is an instructor in the Horticulture department who makes courses on permaculture at the Oregon University, in introductory or advanced levels. Some of these courses are online, which allows him to reach the houses of hundreds of students. In which he uses an Augmented Reality sandbox, that allows him to create different variations of terrains and run simple water simulations in real time. In other words, he's using technology to facilitate the understanding of nature, but then again, here we're losing an essential part of the learning process.

It is because of the above mentioned points that we propose the creation of an accessible interactive simulator that allows the user to do everything that's possible with Andrew's sandbox. That would facilitate the learning process for both the teacher and the students. The main features of this tool should be:



As we said before, there's not a clear answer to the current crisis, but in an attempt to help, we propose to create an accessible interactive simulator that allows the user to do everything that's possible with Andrew's sandbox. That would facilitate the learning process for both the teacher and the students. The main features of this tool should be:

There're lot of instructors and teachers like Andrew around the world that are using digital platforms. But there's a clear issue: Online classes could imply losing the active learning that we could have doing said classes in a classroom. In this particular case, we lose part of the active learning just by the fact that nature requires time to develop, to evolve.

This is a perfect example of how technology could be use to affront our current crisis, educating the new generations that could find the answer to affront the crisis, but we're losing an important part here: active learning.




characteristics of these courses is that they are online, which allows him to reach the homes of hundreds of students. Given such a large quantity, and the limitations of a digital platform used, it can be difficult to meet the needs of all his students or capture what is taught in a simple way, even more so because the subject is more practical than theoretical. 

In an attempt to make his classes easier to understand, Andrew started using a system composed of a sandbox, sensors and a projector that allows him to create different variations of terrains and run simple simulations in real time 



With it, he can display contour lines on the sandbox or add elements to his sandbox such as water and trees to see how they interact with the terrain in different configurations. This allows his students to easily visualize the concepts being studied, and more importantly, because it’s a simulation of what happens in nature, they can see them in accelerated time. Thus removing one of the most significant limitations associated with the study of permaculture. 

While it is true that this presents a significant advance for what are online permaculture classes, this is a configuration too complex or impossible for their students to replicate it at home. The practical work is very important, and given the time limitations related to nature itself, it’s a difficult task to do without having a working environment like the one Andrew’s has
