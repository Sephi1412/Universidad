# Unit 6B (p. 144)

> - We use ``used to / didn’t use to + base form`` to talk about past habits or repeated actions or situations/states that have changed
> - `Used to` doesn't exist in the present tense. For present habits we use `usually + simple present`
>   - For Exmaple, *I usually walk to work* **NOT** *I used to walk to work*
> - We can also use *would* to refer to repeated actions in the past. However, we don't use would for *nonactions verbs*.
>   - For example *be, have, know, like, etc*
