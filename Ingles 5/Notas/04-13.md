## Analysis
1.  Think carefully what to say when you begin a discussion.
   - Yes, you might regret it if you don't do it
2. Try to “ win” the argument as quickly as you can
   - We don't think it's a good option. You may use weak arguments if you are doing it quick
3. Say sorry if something really is your fault.
   - Yeah, that's a good advice. If you do it, the other person is going to be more receptive with you
4. Never avoid an argument by refusing to talk.
   - That's also a good advice. There's a reason of why you are having an argument in the first place
5. Don't talk about things that aren’t relevant to the argument
   - Yeah, that's a good tip too. No one enjoys when someone changes the topic and evade the issue hand
6. Use another person to mediate.
 - I'm not so sure about this one. I have never meditated before. Maybe it could help you to be more calm during discussions.
7. Postpone the argument until later when you have both calmed down.
   - Yeah, when people are not thinking straight, they might say mean things to the other.
8. It’s a bad thing for a couple to argue.
   - I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, if you don't shout to your couple. If you're having an argue, it because something it's wrong that needs to be fixed. It's necessary to argue about it to know how to fix it
