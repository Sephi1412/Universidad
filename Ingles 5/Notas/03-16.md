# Imaginary Situations

## Unreal Conditionals
- General Struct: 
  - `if` + *simple past*, `would/wouldn't` *base form* (second conditional)
  - `if` + *past participle*, *would/wouldn't have* + *past participle* (third conditional)
- Specifics:
    1) We use second conditional sentences to talk about a hypothetical or imaginary situation in the **present or future** and it's consequences
    2) In the *if-clause* you can also use the past continuous. In the other clause you can use *could* or *might* instead of would.
    3) With the verb *be* you can use was **was** or **were** for *I, He and She* in the *if-clause*
