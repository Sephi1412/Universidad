# Used
## Used to

We use ``used to / didn’t use to + base form`` to talk about past habits or repeated actions or situations/states that have changed
- `Used to` doesn't exist in the present tense. For present habits we use `usually + simple present`

## Be used to
- We use `be used to + gerund` to talk about a new situation that **is** now familiar

## Get used to
- We use `get used to + gerund` to talk about a new situation that is **becoming** familiar


# Present Modals
> `Must/Might/May/Can't/Couldn't` + **have** + *past participle*

1. When you are sure about something is true: `must`
    - *They must be out. There aren't any lights on*
2. When you think something is possible true: `may/might`
    - *His phone is turned off. He might be on the plane now*
3. When you are sure something is impossible/not true: `can't`
    - *He can't be sick. I just saw him at the gym*

# Strong Adjectives
- If before an adjective is a demonstrative term (i.e "this", "the", "that"), then it means it's a weak adjective. If there not demonstrative term before, then is strong.
- Strong adjectives are not graduable or measurable. 

# Notas
- Past participle: suele comportarse como adjetivo y verbo al mismo tiempo
