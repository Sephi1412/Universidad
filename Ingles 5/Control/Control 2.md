# Reported Speech
1. [Useful Link](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/reported-speech.html)
2. We reference or report something that someone thinks or says. For example:
	- Direct Speech: I like ice cream
	- Reported Speech: She **says** that she **likes** ice cream
3. When we're transforming a "direct speech" that uses words like "will" or "can" that establish *certainty*, then we have to use "would" or "could" in it's "reported speech" version.
4. **It's possible to change the time of the sentence**. For example:
   - *Direct Speech*: The sky is blue.
   - *Reported Speech*: She said that the sky **was** blue
5. We don't use questions in Reported Speech
   - *Direct Speech*: Where is Julie?
   - *Reported Speech*: She asked me where Julie ``was``
6. **There're differences if the question is related to answer with a yes/no**
   - Do you like chocolate?
   -  She asked me **if** I liked chocolate.
