## Question 17

### Would you choose immortality if you had a chance? Why or why not? (Cristian)

> If I had the chance, I wouldn't choose immortality, because if I did, i'm would to see my love ones died, i would to lose every person that I care in this life. And eventually, life itself ii would lose meaning to me. Why would I want to be immortality if I couldn't enjoy it with the people that I love? I think it's better to be young forever.
